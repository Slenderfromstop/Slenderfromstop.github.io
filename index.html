>What is the alt-right?<br>
>Due to the rapid spread of the internet and the evolution of digital spaces the nature of human interaction has changed, with memes being both aesthetically and contextually capable of informing digital and physical space, I must consider how subcultures within the alt-right have developed and how imagery, specifically that of the incel, has been utilised by artists both positively and negatively.<br>
>This critical report will address the impact that memes have on contemporary art when co-opted by the alt-right within a post internet society.<br>
>To analyse the impact of memes on contemporary art when co-opted by the alt-right within a post internet society, I must first outline what that alt-right is.<br>
>Short for ‘alternative right’, the alt-right is a term that first appeared in 2010, gaining widespread traction and popularity in 2016.<br>
>Individuals who align themselves with the alt-right distinguish themselves from traditional or mainstream conservatism in favour of forms of conservatism that embrace implicit or explicit racism or white supremacy.<br>
>Furthermore, the alt-right is defined by the European centre for populism studies as “a mainstream conservative politics and espouse extremist beliefs and policies typically centred on ideas of white nationalism”.<br>
>This definition of the alt-right addresses their sensibilities but does not align them within the era of the internet where the far-right has congregated on chatrooms, boosting the popularity of involved groups.<br>
>Sam Moore and Alex Roberts distinguish politics within a post-Internet society as “Post-internet is not a time after the internet, but a time in which the internet has receded into the background of how life appears to simply be. It is no longer remarkable that politics is mediated through the internet” (2021).<br>
>Utilising the analysis Moore and Roberts provide within Post Internet Far Right: fascism in the Age of the Internet, I intend to reflect on how politics, specifically that of the alt-right, has bled into internet culture and how it has subsequently had an impact on contemporary art.<br>
>Throughout this report I will consider contemporary art practices within the age of the internet, and how a post internet society conducts itself politically online through the aesthetics of the meme.<br>
>I specifically intend to analyse Hito Steyerls “The Poor Image,” Mauro C. Martinez, Lorena Levi, and the gallery LD50 to understand how artists and art institutions have utilised the rapidly evolving culture of the internet and the alt-right. <br>
>Chapter 1 - The alt-right, the internet and the aesthetic of the meme<br>
>Memes, much like contemporary art forms, serve as an influential vehicle for cultural expression, commentary, and social interaction.<br>
>The overall capacity for memes to portray complex issues through easily digestible, often humorous content, positions them as distinctive and influential mediums of communication.<br>
>Memes, much like traditional art forms, possess multiple layers of meaning.<br>
>They can offer commentary on politics, culture, and society.<br>
>However, their design being quickly consumable, humorous images makes them distinct in their function.<br>
>Memes work within the realm of internet culture, and their impact is decided by their ability to be understood and circulated rapidly.<br>
>In many ways, they are the modern equivalent of political cartoons or satirical art, expressing critique, forming commentaries, and creating ideological positions through visuals and short text.<br>
>Helena Schmitt (2019) recognised that “The viral meme production was not only conducted by humorous or critical private commenters, but also artists” further examining the nature in which memes and subsequently, the internet, has informed and shaped contemporary art in both subject and practise.<br>
>Hito Steyerl's ‘The Poor Image’ (2009) offers an intriguing framework for understanding the role of digital imagery within contemporary culture.<br>
>Steyerl argues digital images have lost the value attributed to their physical and aesthetic qualities, unlike traditional high-resolution artworks.<br>
>Poor images are typically compressed, pixelated, and fragmented, which makes them ideally suited for rapid dissemination across digital networks “Poor images are dragged around the globe as commodities to their effigies, or as gifts or bounty. They spread pleasure or death threats, conspiracy theories or bootlegs, resistance or stultification” (Steyerl.H, 2009). <br> 
>Steyerl contends that the proliferation of such images has democratised access to art but, simultaneously, has devalued the traditional notions of the arts.<br>
>Similarly, memes are intentionally designed to be simple and accessible; they are also often low resolution designed to be sharable to ensure their viral potential.<br>
>They reflect a new era of art that does not require the viewer to visit a gallery or museum, instead allowing people to engage with them on their smartphones, on social media, or within online forums.<br>
>Reflecting further through the lens of memes and the internet, Steyerl creates the argument that memes align with the evolving nature of contemporary art, characterised by fluidity and the ability to shape both public discourse and personal identity.<br>
>Art is a dynamic evolving form of human expression.<br>
>As society endures change, as does art, adapting to modern technologies, political landscapes, and cultural trends.<br>
>Memes as products of the internet age represent a significant evolution in the realm of cultural expression.<br>
>Their rapid development and widespread influence make them an important medium for political discourse and cultural commentary within contemporary society, especially among younger, digitally engaged generations.<br>
>Regarding the Alt-right, memes are also designed to be accessible and shareable, much like the “poor image” that Steyerl describes.<br>
>Alt-right memes are simple, crude, easy to produce, and much like a regular meme, they are easy to share across social media platforms.<br>
>When co-opted by the alt-right, memes assume more of a sinister function, acting as a tool for subtle propaganda and alt-right indoctrination.<br>
>The alt-right capitalises on the viral nature of memes to further its agenda.<br>
>What distinguishes alt-right memes is the blending of ideological messaging and humour, enabling users to engage with these memes without automatically being able to recognise the political content embedded within them.<br>
>“To the untrained eye, extreme right memes are politically incorrect or edgy satire, not political terrorist content.<br>
>However, their specialised in-jokes jargon, which often reference innocuous pop culture items […] are often uploaded with the intention of ‘rolling brazen racism’ as ‘half joking.’ By consequence, the ubiquity of this niche style of humour reinforces the in-group identity of alt-right chan anons” (De Satge.F, 2021).<br>
>Utilising humour these memes can obscure their true intentions.<br>
>The capacity for the alt-right to normalise extremist ideas through memes has fundamentally altered the ways in which people interact both online and offline.<br>
>The vitality of memes and their ability to rapidly spread across social media platforms has allowed alt-right ideology to reach individuals who may not otherwise encounter these views, facilitating the spread of extremist ideology.<br>
>What begins as a harmless joke or satirical comment can, over time, contribute to shifting cultural attitudes and make once-taboo viewpoints more socially acceptable.<br>
>As De Satge (2021) suggests, the use of "edgy" humour in alt-right memes plays a crucial role in reinforcing the in-group identity of alt-right communities.<br>
>This normalisation process can lead to the radicalisation of individuals who may initially engage with the memes for entertainment purposes but, over time, internalise the extremist ideologies they promote.<br>
>By analysing the evolution of ‘Pepe the frog’ created by American artist Matt Furie in 2005 for his comic series “Boy’s Club” you can examine how online meme culture has appropriated nonpolitical imagery and redeployed it for sometimes extreme political purposes.<br>
>Pepe The Frog was very quickly adapted as a meme on internet forums such as 4chan and reddit, politicised Pepe memes began to surface around 2014 to 2015 against Furie’s wishes with many of the memes appearing from the alt-right.<br>
>Pepe was added to the Anti-defamation League’s database of hate symbols in 2016 due to a stream of racist and anti-semitic renderings being produced and widespread online.<br>
>The way in which ‘Pepe The Frog’ was co-opted by the alt-right for their own aesthetic purpose of hate shows they way in online meme culture serves as a vehicle for political commentary, furthermore it shows how artists work can be twisted to create memes whether they are encouraged by the artist or not.<br>
>Memes are aesthetically and contextually capable of influencing both digital and physical spaces.<br>
>The evolution of memes as a medium mirror the changing nature of contemporary art spaces themselves, while their accessibility and viral potential positions them as potent tools for political expression and social commentary.<br>
>However, when utilised by the alt right memes assume a more troubling role, subtly reinforcing extremist ideologies while masking their political intent behind the guise of humour.<br>
>This dual nature, combining entertainment and ideological messaging underscores the complex relationship between art, politics, and society within the digital age.<br>
>As memes continue to shape online discourse, it is crucial to recognise their power to affect cultural attitudes and political behaviour, particularly within the context of the alt-right.<br>
>Chapter 2- Mauro c. martinez and Lorena Levi, how artists interact with the incel<br>
>The internet has transformed from an environment of ostensibly infinite potential into one reflecting complexities, contradictions, and dangers within contemporary society.<br>
>The advent of the internet represents a paradigm shift noted by Fernandez (2021) which has “radically changed the world order from globalisation to hyper-connectivity and digitalisation”.<br>
>As digital spaces continue to evolve, the nature of human interaction and the propagation of ideologies also undergo transformation.<br>
>One particularly notable development is the ascent of the alternative right and its adjoining groups, such as incels, which have been nurtured within online communities.<br>
>Born from marginalised subcultures on the internet, these groups have gained significant notability in recent years, exploiting digital platforms to spread messages of misogyny, resentment, and reactionary ideologies.<br>
>Engagement with such movements in the context of internet based contemporary practise can be examined from multiple perspectives.<br>
>In particular, artistic reinterpretations of the Alt-right’s visual language and the iconography of the incels offer a means of deconstructing and subverting the symbols and tropes associated with these groups.<br>
>However, in doing so a critical question arises in the endeavour to challenge these ideologies; could artistic intervention potentially inadvertently uphold the alt-rights agenda, thereby facilitating a descent into the alt-right pipeline?<br>
>Broaching the topic of the post internet within the art world Archey and Peckham (2024) denote that “In the context of artistic practise, the category of the post-internet describes an art object created with a consciousness of the networks within it exists, from conception and production to dissemination and reception” Within contemporary art this raises a broader question: how should one engage with online movements, not just as subject, but as a deeper, more systemic issue within online culture itself.<br>
>Mauro C. Martinez situating himself between both historian and iconoclast, has gained recognition for his exploration of conventions that link existing viral memes, cursed images, and traditional oil painting.<br>
>His work challenges the presumed divide between these seemingly contrasting forms of image-making.<br>
>Martinez utilises the never-ending onslaught of online imagery blending the traditional techniques of oil painting with internet subcultures and aesthetics.<br>
>“His [Martinez’s] paintings are not just humorous, but they also brim with metaphors and irony, capturing the essence of internet culture”. (Gordon.L, 2023).<br>
>The intersection of online culture, post-internet art and memes can often blur the lines between that of artistic expression and political propaganda.<br>
>Martinez’s interaction with meme culture and the figure of the incel, however, could be perceived a superficial, particularly given the way in which Martinez appropriates meme iconography.<br>
>Gabrielle de la Puente, in an article for ‘The White Pube’ (2023) critiques a painting from 2020 by Martinez in his ‘sensitive content’ series depicting the murder of George Floyd.<br>
>Puente questions the ethical implications of an artist profiting from the suffering of marginalised communities, especially when the artist, as Puente notes, “is a prolific price-on-request kind of artist”.<br>
>This raises the question of who, if anyone, would purchase such works.<br>
>While Martinez states that his intention is to construct thought provoking discussion surrounding censorship and human-computer relationships, specifically in the ‘RateMySetUp’ exhibition, Where Martinez claims to “empathise with my subjects by painting their environments” (Martinez.M, 2023).<br>
>However, Martinez further commented in an interview with Artist Decoded in 2021 that “my goal as an artist – and I consider it the highest honour- is to just document what’s happening, and to that end, I think that’s why it’s important to be as ideologically clean as you can, and be without agenda, and be somebody who just listens to what is happening and doesn’t respond with ego or anything like that. Then you can present a balanced statement that is not polarising and is filled with the nuance today, that we’re severely lacking”.<br>
>Martinez claiming that his work is purely documentation and ‘ideologically clean’ does not allow space for criticism of the politics held within the imagery being used.<br>
>Utilising meme iconography from alt-right spaces, claiming a practise that is disengaging from politics, reducing imagery down to its humour and absurdity only, creates a practise that is not rigorously engaging with the subject, it can become dangerous.<br>
>On the use of humour and irony in alt-right environments Sienkiewicz and Marx (2022) reflect on how the right is using humour and satire to recruit and radicalise supporters; using symbolism co-opted by the alt-right, whilst still trying to project humour, can end up pandering to the audience the artist is trying to avoid.<br>
>It could be argued that there is a need for humour within art that is about political spaces.<br>
>Martinez effectively portrays a reflection of the internet and user engagement in an absurd and funny way, much like Martinez’s piece “Trust” (2022).<br>
>The piece depicts a laptop sat precariously on a desk made of flimsy cardboard showing the desperation of the subject and their need to be online, effectively creating a humorous impression of the lengths an individual might go to engage with cyberspaces, embodying the nature of the subreddit that Martinez’s exhibition is named after.<br>
>However, artworks reflecting on politics through humour must be engaged; Martinez declaring a practise that is withdrawn from its subject weakens the intent.<br>
>Through the lens of cyberfeminism we can further dissect the role of the artist in depicting the incel.<br>
>With computers and developing technologies being largely seen as dominated by men, and the alt-right alongside incels reflecting this bias, “Like women, software systems are used as a man's tools, his media and his weapons; are all developed in the interests of man, but are all poised to betray him”.<br>
>(Plant.<br>
>S, 1998) Cyberfemininist’s aim to utilise cyber-space to bring about sexual revolution and disrupt patriarchal structures, using the internet to connect with other women and create spaces to critique gendered and hateful environments.<br>
>Subverting the idea that techno-culture is inherently masculine and highlighting that there is the ability to change the rhetoric within online subcultures, Lorena Levi is an artist using the patriarchy to reclaim spaces on the internet.<br>
>Levi utilises the internet within her practice as a starting point for research, making use of the internet to converse with strangers on chat room sites, as well as to listen to podcasts displaying real people to gain stories for her paintings.<br>
>In MAXXED (2023) Levi explores the interpersonal relationships and psychology of the online spheres of incels, prescribing an unseen tenderness whilst still often displaying an injection of absurdity and humour.<br>
>The exhibition title MAXXED further alludes to the notion of ‘maxxing,’ incel ideology that functions as a suffix to refer to actions aimed at improving some aspect of one’s sexual market value.<br>
>For example, looksmaxxing suggests an attempt at improving one’s general appearance, this further entwines the aesthetic and ideals of the incel into Levi’s practise.<br>
>In preparation, Levi carried out chatroom-based interviews with members of the subreddit ‘IncelExit,” a subreddit that provides space for over 14 thousand subscribers that were drawn into the incel community but are now searching for support to leave the manosphere.<br>
>Each painting produced by Levi for the MAXXED (2023) exhibition orbits around conversations with the subscribers in an aim to visually contextualise the frustration, desperation, and shame hidden in its digital abditory.<br>
>Levi would reach out to members of “IncelExit”, who were seeking advice, with questions tailored to each individual's post, asking about their personal history and experiences delving into why they believe they may have gotten to the position of incel self-identification, responses from members responses with awareness of the nature of the group.<br>
>All participants involved in Levi’s research were aware of her status as an artist and Levi’s intentions to produce a body of work based on their responses, however, Levi noted that none of the individuals she interviewed questioned her gender.<br>
>Meaning, it was assumed that Levi’s participation within the ‘IncelExit’ subreddit meant she was male.<br>
>The question arises that if Levi had disclosed her gender would the stories gathered from the participants be much more guarded or defensive.<br>
>With Levi concealing her identity when reaching out to the subreddit, even if Levi were never asked about her gender by the group, could be perceived or be partaking in ‘identity tourism'.<br>
>A term coined by Lisa Nakamura in 2002 ‘identity tourism is “the process by which members of one group try on for size descriptors generally applied to persons of another race or gender”.<br>
>stripping away identity markers in cyberspace and emerging technologies is problematic, as if gender matters online in the same sense it does offline it counters the repeated assertion that cyberspace is a disembodied realm where gendered and radicalised bodies can be left behind.<br>
>However, Levi’s work acknowledges this.<br>
>Cyberspaces and the internet do not leave behind ascribed labels and some subcultures, such as the alt-right and incels, perpetuate hateful rhetoric specifically to uphold these labels.<br>
>Levi’s painting “A Second Doll” (2023) is a depiction of conversation Levi had with a Norwegian man who imparted how his relationship with his mother was disconnected, and how this affected his relationship with his sister causing them to be closer.<br>
>The painting depicts two children stood side by side; the young girl cradling a doll and the boy stood beside her covered in stickers, showing how the sister regarded him as more of a plaything.<br>
>The older woman in the painting sits facing away from the viewer disengaged, almost uncaring.<br>
>Through this painting Levi portrays the complexities of early childhood and how it can become the foundation of one's gender ideals, further delving into how it may affect young men later in their lives and why they may enter incel spaces online.<br>
>Both Martinez and Levi’s first point of contact within their works is the internet through the lens of the alt-right, Martinez through aesthetics and Levi through first-hand research.<br>
>Each of them approaching the notion of cyberspace with differing concerns.<br>
>Martinez and Levi depict the varying roles artists have within reinterpreting the visual language of the alt-right showing the importance, as well as the negative effects, artists have in confronting the echo-chambers of the alt-right on the internet.<br>
>Continuing this line of thought, a study done by the University of Exeter raised concerns after discovering the nature of online incel activity, how it has become more extreme embedding itself deeper into the real world and how this movement into the everyday has later had an impact on discussions online.<br>
>Sites encouraging alt-right activity get shut down and new ones appear just as quickly to take their place, hosting dehumanising language that depicts violence towards women.<br>
>Meaning it is more important than ever to reflect on the ways in which Artists and institutions are responding to the uptick in the alt-right and whether they are causing more discourse.<br>
>Chapter 3- LD50, why it is not just contemporary discourse<br>
>The Gallery LD50 can be observed as a case study of the impact that the alt-right, and the adjacent group of incels, have had on contemporary art within the age of the internet.<br>
>LD50, an independent gallery from the London art scene; located in Dalston, Hackney, was the topic of discussion in 2017 concerning its activities in orchestrating talks by alt-right extremists.<br>
>LD50 presented talks on genetics, genomes, technology, and transhumanism; explicitly engaging with notions of the post internet, also showing young artists that displayed aesthetics tied to the internet.<br>
>However, the series of alt-right presentations held by LD50 went unnoticed until it discovered that in 2016, LD50 organised a conference titled “neo-reaction” that featured speakers connected with the alt-right.<br>
>LD50’s conference and exhibition with its ‘alt-right inspired’ ideologies, speakers, and themes facilitated open discussion of extremist beliefs within a contemporary art institution.<br>
>The speakers involved within these conferences included: “Nick Land, as well as Brett “democracy-destroys-white-people” Stevens (Amerika), anti-immigration activist Peter Brimelow (VDare), masculinist Mark Citadel (Return of Kings), and antifeminist journalist Iben Thranholm (European culture became feminized, men act like women, aggressive migrants are raping German women in the streets, we need a male revolution, we need to go back to old male values)”.(Gogarty, 2017).<br>
>Moreover Nick land being the most notable speaker, “Nick Land was one of the most widely acknowledged to be an intellectual inspiration for segments of the alt-right, though he retains some residual credibility in the art world” (Nolan, 2017) retaining this credibility and further being associated as a familiar figure in art contexts, constructs a contrast in which introducing new speakers through the notion of exploring discourse, or expressing new thought to broaden discussions within the contemporary art world, could be perceived as an endeavour to widen the spectrum of far-right speech circulating contemporary art world via art institution (LD50).<br>
>To Expand on the gallery as institution, Hans Haackne produced art works and criticism of the system exchange between the museum and corporation, framing the gallery as an institution where its influence has socio-political power revealing the hypocrisy of liberal institutions accepting sponsorship from aggressive conservative capitalists.<br>
>As stated by Katsnerer (2020) “His [Haackne’s] practise has argued for more than half a century that, like the things we make, what we do and say should never be understood as discrete or dis-locatable from the world at large; all must be considered – scrutinised and critiqued -  as implicated in the contexts – social, economic, political, spatial, environmental- in which they are produced and encountered”.<br>
>Confronting the gallery as institution, such as The Tate accepting sponsorship from BP from 1990 until 2016, opens up galleries to criticism.<br>
>Particularly, in the case of LD50 where Lucia Diego (the gallery’s director) had positioned LD50 as a project space to ‘explore contemporary discourse’ rather than a space to facilitate extremist right-wing thought.<br>
>Haackne’s conversation surrounding these issues of gallery as institution can be seen in how artistic organisations and the public have insisted on this privilege which, in the case of Haackne, has opened discussion about access and political responsibility that is ongoing within museums.<br>
>LD50 has become an example of the role of the institution in complex political times and how it is a particular concern to contemporary arts, projecting artistic freedom only for it to be co-opted by the far right.<br>
>LD50 reflects how the alt-rights mode of engagement often resembles; if only in sarcasm, irony, and the aim to disrupt, tactics and strategies associated with anti-establishment and leftist techniques.<br>
>Elaborating on LD50’s role in perpetrating ideals upheld by the alt-right, “71822666” was the name for a thread on 4chan predicting Trumps election Victory.<br>
>LD50 adopted the name, utilising it for an exhibition held after the conference.<br>
>The exhibition incorporated pop culture references, candles, crystals, and other altar-like structures, incorporating recently developed technologies (robotic sculptures) referring to contemporary forms of communication, social media.<br>
>Futuristic concepts mixed with the mythical has often produced association and connotations of fascist aesthetics.<br>
>Regarding futuristic praise and concepts “The Fascists and Futurists also shared an acclaim for speed strength, and a fetish for machines and technology” (Maher, 1986) further establishing recognition of the future being substantial within fascist and subsequently futurist aesthetics.<br>
>In consideration of the myth and its relationship to fascism “With the birth of fascism, myth became one and the same with propaganda.<br>
>Demonstration was replaced with fabrication.<br>
>The sacred took the place of the secular.<br>
>Extraordinary explanation eliminated common sense”.<br>
>(Finchelstien, 2022) further denotes the role of the myth in the aesthetics and foundations fascism, and ultimately the Alt-right.<br>
>In addition, it is worth scrutinising why the invitation to both the conference and exhibition was invite only; with the only public announcements of the talks and associated exhibition being available on ‘Amerika.org’ (a nationalist website run by Brett Stevens, one of the speakers hosted by LD50.<br>
>)  With Diego expressing that the conference was intended to “[create] a dialogue between two different and contrasting ideologies” (Diego referenced in Ellis-Peterson, 2017) in a statement on LD50’s website (now inaccessible in 2025) expressing that the intended audience for the conference was very liberal.<br>
>However, with the symposium being invitation only and the venue name being shrouded in secrecy on ‘Amerika.org,’ it could be inferred that there was contradiction in Diegos stance of simply creating dialogue.<br>
>Not only due to the apparent partnership between Stevens and Diego, but also due to the audience as well as the associated speakers being sympathetic to views held within these discussions.<br>
>“a recording of Brimelow’s talk reveals that members of the audience who contributed to the discussion were predominately sympathetic to his views, agreeing with his statement about the need to remove the “corrupt treacherous elite” in government and one professing support for David Duke, the former Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and Holocaust denier”.(Ellis-peterson, 2017).<br>
>However, it could be argued that contemporary artists, although encouraged to push boundaries, must operate within the limitations of self-censorship and the fear of backlash; Natalie Lambet in an interview regarding the LD50 controversy reflects on the educational arts institutions and censorship, “What kind of art is and isn’t supported by supported in the educational institution?<br>
>What are the silent terms and conditions of me making work in this institution?<br>
>The tutors felt the work was interesting, but that it would be perfect in a private gallery, not a show related to CSM [Central Saint Martins].<br>
>Where we are told we are free to explore our practise, push its boundaries and test limitations, I now understand this is actually a very small window to operate within”.(2017).<br>
>This could lead to the acknowledgement that spaces, such as LD50, hold and influential role within the contemporary art world in advocating for the freedom of speech and expression.<br>
>However, it is vital to understand that the freedom of speech is the right to articulate one’s opinions without fear of government retaliation, not the right to be given a platform (free from criticism) to do so.<br>
>“Defences of the Far-right, white-supremacist ideas made in the name of free speech imagine that such debates can be held neutrally. What they fail to understand is that while the art world likes to imagine itself as a free space for liberal exploration of ideas, this is a delusion only permissible to those who never have to feel vulnerable on the street”.(Gogarty, 2017).<br>
>Disregarding the links between the alt-right and contemporary art within the age of the internet, reducing issues down to a matter of freedom of speech and expression, “leaves leftist collective demands and counter positions against far-right advocates on the back foot”.(Malik, 2019) <br> 
.It opens contemporary art practise to hateful rhetoric as well as the alt-right pipeline, especially when connections to alt-right or incel ideologies are overlooked, the acute societal fetishisation concerning the autonomy of art has become a function for sanctioning and legitimising far right provocation.<br>
>LD50 closed its doors in 2017 due to continued protest in response to its “neo-reactionary” conference that took place within the establishment.<br>
>Conclusion <br>
>This critical report is aimed at artists who inhabit the internet, galleries utilising the post-internet, theorists who are concerned with evolution of the internet, and individuals interested in the relationship between contemporary art and memes when co-opted by the alt-right.<br>
>Several topics that are highlighted and discussed and the points that are made especially target these individuals' interests.<br>
>The layout of this report is traditionally academic, but a text reflecting the style of 4chans notorious ‘GreenTexts’ can be found at [Right Here!].<br>
>Drawing conclusions on my findings it is clear that the alt-right has influenced both contemporary artists and art institutions within a post internet society.<br>
>The focus of this report was refined through the discussion of Haackne’s criticisms and how they centre the implications and ramifications of liberal institutions and galleries accepting sponsorship from aggressive conservative capitalists.<br>
>Rooting Haackne’s work within the case Study of LD50 has allowed for a more in-depth discussion of what it means to push boundaries within the gallery, whether that is positive or not.<br>
>Furthermore, by dissecting artists working directly with the internet, such as Martinez and Levi, allowed for the dissection of the aesthetics of the incel and how they are perceived online.<br>
>Moreover, the way artists depict the alt-right within their work can influence how those who interact with their pieces may interact with the alt-right.<br>
>The examples of theory, artists, and institutions I have included demonstrate how the internet creates an echo-chamber for political movements and how interactions with said groups through contemporary art theory and practice can change the public’s view and how that can create harm.<br>
>Within my practice I aim to continue exploring how contemporary art interacts with internet-based iconography and embedded political imagery to create a dialogue surrounding the proliferation of alt-right ideology through memes and the resulting effect on internet-based artworks.<br>
